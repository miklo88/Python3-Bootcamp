First Milestone Project.
Tic Tac Toe for 2 players

1)2 players should be able to play the game
(Both sitting at the same computer)
2)The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
3)You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board.

lets break these down into smaller problems
-quick rundown
use the numpad to match numbers to the grid on a tic tac toe board:
[789]
[456]
[123]
this is the layout for our x's and o's

how do i get a user to understand what number to input for their x or o input.
check to see if someone has won or tied.

##quick peek at game
on start
player 1: do you want to be x or o?
think of battleship for player input.
Do you want to play again? yes or no? If yes, play again, if no show messages for win, loss, or not finished.
